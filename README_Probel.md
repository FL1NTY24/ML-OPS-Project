Smart Healthcare: Predicting Patient Readmission Risk

Problem Description:

Hospitals face challenges in managing patient readmissions, which increase costs and impact patient outcomes. I built an ML model to predict the likelihood of patient readmission within 30 days based on medical history, demographics, and treatment data. I've deployed the model as a web service for hospital staff to prioritize high-risk patients and implement preventive measures.
