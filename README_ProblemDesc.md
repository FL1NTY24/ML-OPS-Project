Smart Healthcare: Predicting Patient Readmission Risk

Problem Description:

Hospital readmissions for diabetic patients are a significant challenge, driven by factors such as disease complexity, limited health literacy, social determinants, and healthcare system inefficiencies. These readmissions increase costs and adversely affect patient outcomes, with billions spent annually in the U.S. alone. To address this, I developed a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a diabetic patient being readmitted within 30 days, using features like age, medical history, diagnoses, and hospital stay details from the UCI Diabetes 130-Hospitals Dataset. The model is deployed as a web service, enabling clinicians and hospital administrators to identify high-risk patients and prioritize preventive interventions, ultimately improving care and reducing costs.
