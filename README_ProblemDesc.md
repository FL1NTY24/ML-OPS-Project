Smart Healthcare: Predicting Patient Readmission Risk

Problem Description:

Hospital readmissions for diabetic patients are a significant challenge, driven by factors such as disease complexity, limited health literacy, social determinants, and healthcare system inefficiencies. These readmissions increase costs and adversely affect patient outcomes, with billions spent annually in the U.S. alone. To address this, I developed a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a diabetic patient being readmitted within 30 days, using features like age, medical history, diagnoses, and hospital stay details from the UCI Diabetes 130-Hospitals Dataset. The model is deployed as a web service, enabling clinicians and hospital administrators to identify high-risk patients and prioritize preventive interventions, ultimately improving care and reducing costs.

The dataset represents ten years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. Each row concerns hospital records of patients diagnosed with diabetes, who underwent laboratory, medications, and stayed up to 14 days. The goal is to determine the early readmission of the patient within 30 days of discharge. The problem is important for the following reasons. Despite high-quality evidence showing improved clinical outcomes for diabetic patients who receive various preventive and therapeutic interventions, many patients do not receive them. This can be partially attributed to arbitrary diabetes management in hospital environments, which fail to attend to glycemic control. Failure to provide proper diabetes care not only increases the managing costs for the hospitals (as the patients are readmitted) but also impacts the morbidity and mortality of the patients, who may face complications associated with diabetes.
